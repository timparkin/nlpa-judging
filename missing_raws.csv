Her innovative techniques involve a blend of camera work, post-processing, and contemporary alternative processes, allowing her to deconstruct and reinterpret images in unique ways.

A dedicated member of Soho Photo Gallery in NYC, Patricia serves as President on the executive board where she plays an active role in shaping and enriching the photographic arts community. Her evocative works are seen in both solo and group exhibitions.

Patricia's international presence is notable, with exhibitions in the US, Italy, Spain, and Japan. Her accomplishments include receiving a Julia Margaret Cameron Award in 2014, an Honorable Mention in the Pollux Awards in 2021, and inclusion in the Photo Review International Competition in 2021.

Often, we overlook the splendor that lies immediately before us because it is part of our daily scenery. I am fortunate to have a small pond adjacent to my residence. Over the years, I have captured images around this pond and admired the diverse beauty they present, changing with the seasons and times of the day. This project aims to celebrate the beauty in our immediate surroundings, which is as captivating as more dramatic landscapes. Renowned photographer Eliot Porter coined the term ""Intimate Landscape,"" which aptly describes this genre of photography.

In our local area, there is an abundance of foliage, bodies of water, hills, and valleys. When combined with the four seasons, this results in a remarkable blend of color and atmosphere, providing numerous opportunities for making stunning images. It is my hope that these selected images bring awareness to the plentiful opportunities at our disposal every day. Additionally, I hope that these images encourage individuals to observe more closely (“see”) and take the time to appreciate the extensive beauty that surrounds us.","Mesquite Flat Sand Dune, California","Mesquite Flat Sand Dune is a small sand dune within the Death Valley National Park in California, USA.

In short order,  the fire burned out of control, causing the town of Jasper to unexpectedly evacuate with just five hours notice.   Amazingly, the town was spared total destruction, but still, one-third of it burned to the ground. 

Six weeks later, the fire was declared ""out"", having scorched 39,000 hectares in of one of Canada’s most beloved national parks—and certainly one of my favourites.

The natural cycle of fire is fascinating: the dangerous devastation, and the slow but certain regrowth. But I’d be lying if I said it didn’t hurt to witness the aftermath. Seeing a landscape I thought I knew, irrevocably altered, is deeply unsettling. For me, it underscores the depth of how we are all inextricably linked to the land, and the growing unease I feel about a hotter, drier future.

So when I first travelled back to Jasper in November 2024, I went not just to document, but to try to show how it feels in the vast landscape. To stand in the aftermath. To absorb the rawness. The visceral hit. The evidence of what had just happened. To see the path of destruction the wind and reported fire tornado had wreaked upon the land. To hear the stories of the people who lived through a terrifying event, and are, right now, rebuilding.

It's an honour to try and translate what may be called a disaster zone into  photography—not the softened version, tempered by time and renewal—but the harsh immediacy of what remains. To see the starkness, and find the beauty... for there is beauty in everything.

The landscape has changed. But the beauty and spirit of the place endures.

The natural cycle of fire is fascinating: the dangerous devastation, and the slow but certain regrowth. But I’d be lying if I said it didn’t hurt to witness the aftermath.

In short order,  the fire burned out of control, causing the town of Jasper to unexpectedly evacuate with just five hours notice.   Amazingly, the town was spared total destruction, but still, one-third of it burned to the ground. 

Six weeks later, the fire was declared ""out"", having scorched 39,000 hectares in of one of Canada’s most beloved national parks—and certainly one of my favourites.

The natural cycle of fire is fascinating: the dangerous devastation, and the slow but certain regrowth. But I’d be lying if I said it didn’t hurt to witness the aftermath. Seeing a landscape I thought I knew, irrevocably altered, is deeply unsettling. For me, it underscores the depth of how we are all inextricably linked to the land, and the growing unease I feel about a hotter, drier future.

So when I first travelled back to Jasper in November 2024, I went not just to document, but to try to show how it feels in the vast landscape. To stand in the aftermath. To absorb the rawness. The visceral hit. The evidence of what had just happened. To see the path of destruction the wind and reported fire tornado had wreaked upon the land. To hear the stories of the people who lived through a terrifying event, and are, right now, rebuilding.

They support diverse plants and animals that sometimes exist nowhere else.  In the hopes of sharing the deep reverence I have for these places I have chosen to highlight one place in particular that juxtaposes the natural world with human influence--Channel Islands National Park.  Santa Cruz Island, one of 5 islands in the unit, contains many of the park's 143 endemic species from the Island fox to the San Miguel Island milkvetch.  There you can see side-by-side the destruction that human development causes these incredible places (not to mention the unseen marine impacts). On the eastern portion of the park lies a former livestock ranch and trading post that have decimated native species since the mid-1800s.  In the spring you can see endless fields of introduced grasses and forbs that have pushed out the native flora and with that their native pollinators.  It would take decades and untold amounts of money to restore this land to what it once was.

roy.hereiam@gmail.com,,roy.hereiam@gmail.com,roy.hereiam@gmail.com,Partha Roy,Partha Roy,,,,https://www.facebook.com/partha967,@mypixelmagic,"An avid and self-taught photographer who is an I.T. engineer by profession but a photographer by passion. Partha is a Singapore-based photographer, originally from Uttarpara, which is a small town in West Bengal, India. His passion and hobby in photography gradually made him a photographer, and he always liked to spend his free time with his camera and photography. He also enjoys traveling and flying. As a photographer, Partha can subliminally communicate emotions and feelings randomly hidden in life’s compositions. Many consider Partha an artistic poet and storyteller who uses photographs as his vehicle. He is a picture-taker, fun-lover, and fun-maker photographer who likes to capture and freeze the moments of every aspect of life and the beauty of nature through his photography to make them unforgettable.

By nature, he is a wildlife/travel photographer and likes to do bird photography, but he started as a landscape/cityscape photographer, where “Black and White” is one of his favorite matters to play. During his photography journey, he understood that when someone understands the true aesthetics of art and takes control of creativity, can learn, and deliver the beauty of photography where the subject doesn't define your boundaries.

He has won many prestigious photography awards in different categories, both internationally and locally. He was one of the winners of the 2022 WNPA (World Nature Photography Awards), won 1st prize in the Tamron Photo Contest (Theme: WILDLIFE) in 2021, and in the same year he also won the Bronze award in SINWP (Society of International Nature & Wildlife Photographers) alongside the 3rd prize in World Photographic Cup (WPC) 2021 (representing Singapore). He has also earned some FIAP (Fédération Internationale de l'Art Photographique), PSA (Photographic Society of America), GPU (Global Photographic Union), IAAP (International Association of Art Photographers) medals (Gold, Bronze, Silver), and ribbons from different photography salons and circuits, along with distinction like AFIAP.",https://mypixelmagic.art,3163,cus_OMLR6BjCscVLib,3163,1,0,1,True,,True,,SG,,822636,12100,0,,,,False,,,,,,64836,GS,2025-05-31 15:48:09.877788+00:00,Veins of Fire.jpg,/media/entries/Veins_of_Fire_FfVkShJ.jpg,3000 x 2246,6218766,"[""RG""]",True,default-entry.png,default-entry.png,default-entry.png,default-entry.png,default-entry.png,/media/raws/default-entry.png,/media/raws/default-entry.png,/media/raws/default-entry.png,/media/raws/default-entry.png,/media/raws/default-entry.png
